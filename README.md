# dbus-shelly-pro3em-smartmeter
Integrate Shelly Pro 3EM smart meter into [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus)

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the Shelly Pro 3EM to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.

## How it works
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @RalfZim fronius smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.grid.http_40` or `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_40`
- After successful DBus connection Shelly Pro 3EM is accessed via REST-API - simply the `/rpc/Shelly.GetStatus` is called and a JSON is returned with all details
- Serial/MAC is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls Shelly Pro 3EM data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to `/data/dbus-shelly-pro3em-smartmeter`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
opkg update
opkg install git
git clone https://github.com/entrhopi/dbus-shelly-pro3em-smartmeter.git /data/dbus-shelly-pro3em-smartmeter
/data/dbus-shelly-pro3em-smartmeter/install.sh
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-shelly-pro3em-smartmeter/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | AccessType | Fixed value 'OnPremise' |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | CustomName  | Name of your device - usefull if you want to run multiple versions of the script |
| DEFAULT  | DeviceInstance  | DeviceInstanceNumber e.g. 40 |
| DEFAULT  | Role | use 'GRID' or 'PVINVERTER' to set the type of the shelly 3EM |
| DEFAULT  | Position | Available Postions: 0 = AC, 1 = AC-Out 1, AC-Out 2 |
| DEFAULT  | LogLevel  | Define the level of logging - lookup: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of on-premise Shelly 3EM web-interface |
| ONPREMISE  | Username | Username for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required - `admin` if password is set |
| ONPREMISE  | Password | Password for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
